# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe web application created as a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), designed to be played in your web browser. The game allows two players to take turns, and the first player to align three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the squares are filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
